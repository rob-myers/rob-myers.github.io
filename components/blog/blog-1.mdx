# intro

Human simulation remains a dream, as does the [direct simulation of microscopic flat-worms](#worm). 
<!-- Human simulation remains a dream, as does <Link href="/#worm"><a>direct simulation of microscopic flat-worms</a></Link>.  -->

Alan Turing asked whether a machine could be indistinguishable from a human, restricting interaction to text messages and general knowledge [[Tur50]](#tur-50).
Game AI asks a related question:

> given characters and a particular setting, how can we make the experience as realistic as possible?


Importantly we must also entertain the player, just as Turing's Test was presented as a party game [[Tur50](#tur-50)].


<!-- 

1. Explain how human behaviour is simulated in games.

2. Develop richer behavioural experiences than currently exist. -->
