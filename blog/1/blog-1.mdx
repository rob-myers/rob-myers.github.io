# Behaviour and the Brain

The preface of _Automata Studies_ (1956) begins:

> Among the most challenging scientific questions of our time are the corresponding analytic and synthetic problems: How does the brain function? Can we design a machine which will simulate a brain? [__…__]

> Recent progress in various related fields leads to an optimistic view toward the eventual and not too remote solution of the analytic and synthetic problems.

The first paper in that famous collection characterised the events recognisable by an artificial neural network. That is, Kleene introduced the _regular expressions_. Fifty years later, _Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation_ (2006) had this to say:

> [__…__] in 1979, automata and language theory was still an area of active research. [__…__] Today, there is little direct research in automata theory (as opposed to its applications),and thus little motivation for us to retain the succinct, highly mathematical tone of the 1978 book.
