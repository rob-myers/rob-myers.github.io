# Objectives

Human simulation remains a dream, as does [directly simulating microscopic flat-worms](#worm). 

Alan Turing asked if a machine could be indistinguishable from a human, given communication is restricted to text messages and general knowledge [[Tur50]](#tur-50).
Game AI asks a related question:

> <a name="central-question"/> given the environment and plot, how can we orchestrate characters to behave like humans playing the same roles?

By _environment_ we mean the graphics (how the player sees) and UI (how the player acts). It might be a birdseye 3d view of robots, where the player is moved via the mouse. By _plot_ we mean a (usually dramatic) situation e.g. escaping from soldiers. Rather than attempting to simulate general knowledge, Game AI aims for _good acting over all possible plays_.

<!-- The "judge" is the player, who is usually guided along their own narrative.  -->
<!-- Game AI must entertain the player, not unlike the Turing Test's original presentation as a party game [[Tur50](#tur-50)]. -->

This website:

- explains how video games have attempted to answer the [central question](#central-question).
- develops rich, repeatable behavioural experiences.

In particular, we'll develop an engine online and use it to explain well-travelled techniques.
