# Behaviour and the Brain

We start with the preface of _Automata Studies_ (1956).

> Among the most challenging scientific questions of our time are the corresponding analytic and synthetic problems: How does the brain function? Can we design a machine which will simulate a brain? [__…__]

> Recent progress in various related fields leads to an optimistic view toward the eventual and not too remote solution of the analytic and synthetic problems.

That famous collection starts by characterising the events recognisable by an artificial neural network. This was achieved by introducing the _regular expressions_. We now <Icon title="fast-forward">⏩️</Icon> to the preface of _Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation_ (2006).

> First, in 1979, automata and language theory was still an area of active research. [__…__] Today, there is little direct research in automata theory (as opposed to its applications),and thus little motivation for us to retain the succinct, highly mathematical tone of the 1978 book.
