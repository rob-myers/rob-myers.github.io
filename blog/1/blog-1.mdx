# Behaviour and the Brain

The preface of _Automata Studies_ (1956) made a bold prediction.

> Among the most challenging scientific questions of our time are the corresponding analytic and synthetic problems: How does the brain function? Can we design a machine which will simulate a brain? [__…__]

> Recent progress in various related fields leads to an optimistic view toward the eventual and not too remote solution of the analytic and synthetic problems.

The first paper in this famous collection characterised the events recognisable by an artificial neural network. That is, Stephen Kleene introduced the _regular expressions_. Fifty years later, the third edition of _Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation_ (2006) had this to say.

> [__…__] in 1979, automata and language theory was still an area of active research. [__…__] Today, there is little direct research in automata theory (as opposed to its applications),and thus little motivation for us to retain the succinct, highly mathematical tone of the 1978 book.

<!-- TODO
  - reference OBDDs (post 1970), although this an application
  - but not much research @ foundations i.e. det/nondet/regex
  - ANNs tend to be acyclic layers (Kleene ignored)
  - algebraic automata theory not helpful in applications
    e.g. Krohn-rhodes decomposition too large
  - missing a "nice" mathematical theory of complexity
    e.g. ANN much more succinct than dfa,
    e.g. but nfas allow superstates

Although <Icon title="the above">⬆️</Icon> is heavy-handed, automata theory is no longer the research frontier it once was. It _is_ an active research area (e.g. <Ext href="https://eatcs.org/index.php/best-icalp-paper">ICALP</Ext>, <Ext href="https://link.springer.com/conference/fossacs">FoSSaCS</Ext>, <Ext href="http://lics.siglog.org/">LiCS</Ext>) but it is _not_ driven by clearly defined open problems. Well-established problems exist e.g. those presented by Brzozowski in <Ext href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121153502500075">1979</Ext> and reappraised in <Ext href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01614375v2/document">2015</Ext>, but these conjectures are only on the radar of a select few. Automata theory no longer pursues the two questions posed by _Automata Studies_, nor have they been replaced by refined questions of a similar universal appeal.

What happened?

<!-- The question moved into AI and Computational Complexity -->

<!-- - The questions posed by Automata Studies have universal appeal.
- Artificial Intelligence has PAC Learning
- Computational Complexity has the P vs NP question. -->
