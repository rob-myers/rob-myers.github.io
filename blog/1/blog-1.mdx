# Behaviour and the Brain

The preface of _Automata Studies_ (1956) made a bold prediction.

> Among the most challenging scientific questions of our time are the corresponding analytic and synthetic problems: How does the brain function? Can we design a machine which will simulate a brain? [__…__]

> Recent progress in various related fields leads to an optimistic view toward the eventual and not too remote solution of the analytic and synthetic problems.

The first of this famous collection of papers characterised the events recognisable by an artificial neural network. That is, Kleene introduced the _regular expressions_. Fifty years later, _Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation_ (2006) had this to say.

> [__…__] in 1979, automata and language theory was still an area of active research. [__…__] Today, there is little direct research in automata theory (as opposed to its applications),and thus little motivation for us to retain the succinct, highly mathematical tone of the 1978 book.

<!-- TODO
  - reference Brzozowski/Pin/Straubing work
  - reference OBDDs (post 1970), although this an application
  - but not much research @ foundations i.e. det/nondet/regex
  - ANNs tend to be acyclic layers (Kleene ignored)
  - algebraic automata theory not helpful in applications
    e.g. Krohn-rhodes decomposition too large
  - missing a "nice" mathematical theory of complexity
    e.g. ANN much more succinct than dfa,
    e.g. but nfas allow superstates

This viewpoint is a bit sweeping (e.g. <ExtLink href="https://eatcs.org/index.php/best-icalp-paper">ICALP Track B</ExtLink>). 
Nevertheless, there's been relatively little research concerning finite machines and regular languages.
