# In the beginning

This site has two objectives:

- develop a new theory of finite state machines.
- apply the respective automata-theoretic techniques to web development.

In what sense is it a _theory_? In what sense is it _new_?

Well, there are three new core concepts. Let's set the scene.

### The stag at the heart of the wood

<!-- TODO interactivity begins -->

At the heart of Computer Science lurks regular languages, deterministic finite automata, regular expressions and nondeterministic finite automata. Informally, a _regular language_ is a finite state behaviour represented as a possibly infinite set of words (the _runs_ of the system). _Deterministic finite automata_ and _nondeterministic finite automata_ are "machines" whose behaviour is a regular language. A _regular expression_ is a well-formed program whose behaviour is a regular language. It is more common to say the machine or expression _accepts_ a regular language.

Regular expressions can be directly viewed as nondeterministic automata without any real size increase (TODO example), although not conversely (TODO example).


First, there is a new way to measure nondeterministic automata called [_nondeterministic syntactic complexity_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03039).
