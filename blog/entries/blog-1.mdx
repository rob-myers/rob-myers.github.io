# Machines as solutions 

Biology has revealed our machine-like nature:

- our _genome_ is a word with approximately 64 billion letters.
- our _bodies_ are amalgams of predictable structures.
- our _brains_ represent information using networks of neurons.

But how do such structural properties lead to our emergent behaviour?

This is not an original question. It was a driving force during Computer Science's genesis in the 1930s, 40s and 50s.
Alan Turing and Alonzo Church independently conceived what an _algorithm_ was in 1936.
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts defined _artificial neural networks_ in 1943.
Stephen Kleene defined the _regular languages_ in 1951.
Each defined a new concept and proved it was _expressive_.

- Halting Turing machines capture _solvable yes/no-answer problems concerning any fixed class of finitely representable structures_.
- Church's lambda calculus also captured the _solvable decision problems_.
- Artificial neural networks can express ...
- Kleene's regular languages capture the _events recognisable by an artificial neural network_.
