# Machines as solutions 

Biology has revealed our machine-like nature:

- our _genome_ is a word with approximately 64 billion letters.
- our _bodies_ are amalgams of (relatively) predictable structures.
- our _brains_ represent information using networks of neurons.

We, and all other animals of this world, are miraculous mechanisms.
But the emergence of our collective behaviour from mechanical underpinnings remains a deep mystery.
One objective of this website is to indirectly attack this problem.
Rather than attempting to model the particulars, we present a new richer theory of finite-state-machines by connecting _algebraic automata theory_ to _nondeterministic state complexity_.

In this theory, each cleverly constructed machine with behaviour $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ yields a small biclique edge-covering $\mathscr{C}$ of a natural bipartite graph $\mathcal{SD}_L\subseteq\mathsf{LD}(L)\times\mathsf{syn}(L)$. Crucially, the $\mathscr{C}$ arising in this way are precisely those satisfying:
$$
\mathcal{H} ; \delta_a\text{\u{}} = \mathcal{R}_a ; \mathcal{H}
\qquad
(a \in \Sigma)
$$
where (a) $\mathcal{H}(A \times B, [v]) :\iff v \in B$, (b) $\delta_a$ is right-multiplication in $L$'s syntactic monoid, and (c) $\mathcal{R}_a(A_1 \times B_1,  A_2 \times B_2) :\iff \delta_a[B_2] \subseteq B_1$


<!-- Let us turn to Computer Science in the 1930s, 40s and 50s.
Church and Turing independently conceived what an _algorithm_ was in 1936.
McCulloch and Pitts defined _artificial neural networks_ in 1943 and compared them to Turing machines.
Stephen Kleene defined the _regular languages_ in 1951, capturing the events recognisable by an artificial neural network. -->

> Among the most challenging scientific questions of our time are the corresponding analytic and synthetic problems: How does the brain function? Can we design a machine which will simulate a brain? [__â€¦__]

> Recent progress in various related fields leads to an optimistic view toward the eventual and not too remote solution of the analytic and synthetic problems. -->
