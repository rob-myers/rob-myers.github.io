# In the beginning

This site has two objectives:

- to develop a new theory of finite state machines.
- to propose an automata-theoretic approach to web development.

The first objective is based on ten years of work concerning nondeterministic finite automata (e.g. <Ext href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44124-4_11">a</Ext>, <Ext href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066114000693?via%3Dihub">b</Ext> and <Ext href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03039">c</Ext>). The second objective reflects my current incarnation as a frontend developer. But in what sense do we provide a _theory_? In what sense is it _new_?

Let's set the scene.

### The hart of the wood

<!-- TODO interactivity begins -->

At the heart of Computer Science lurks regular languages, deterministic finite automata, regular expressions and nondeterministic finite automata. Informally, the _regular languages_ are the behaviours of finite state machines. Each regular language is a possibly infinite set of finite words (the _runs_ of the system). _Deterministic finite automata_ and _nondeterministic finite automata_ are important classes of finite state machines. A _regular expression_ is a well-formed program which inductively defines a regular language. Collectively, these concepts

TODO illustrations
- dfa/nfa/regex `/foo|bar/`
- nfa -> dfa
- regex -> nfa
- nfa -> regex

<!--
  dfa: button accepting ridiculous terms and conditions spread over several panes
  nfa: (union + alphabet embed) show message "you've signed away your freedom" on final submit
  nfa: (intersect+) can also go backwards
  nfa: (intersect+) can disable button until scrolled to bottom

  should all be nuclear languages i.e. components + union/intersection
-->

Motivating nfa theory: simplest theory modeling relationship between specification (regular language $L$) and implementations (nondeterministic automata accepting $L$)

Motivating nfa practice: regex are essentially nfas; unknown component problem; automata learning; boolean decision diagrams

Regular expressions can be directly viewed as nondeterministic automata without any real size increase (TODO example), although not conversely (TODO example).

### The mockingbird

First, there is a new way to measure nondeterministic automata called [_nondeterministic syntactic complexity_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03039).
