# Behaviour and the Brain

The preface of _Automata Studies_ (1956) made a bold prediction.

> Among the most challenging scientific questions of our time are the corresponding analytic and synthetic problems: How does the brain function? Can we design a machine which will simulate a brain? [__…__]

> Recent progress in various related fields leads to an optimistic view toward the eventual and not too remote solution of the analytic and synthetic problems.

The first paper in this collection characterised the events recognisable by an artificial neural network. That is, Stephen Kleene introduced the _regular expressions_. Fifty years later, the third edition of _Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation_ (2006) justified its editorial choices.

> First, in 1979, automata and language theory was still an area of active research. [__…__] Today, there is little direct research in automata theory (as opposed to its applications),and thus little motivation for us to retain the succinct, highly mathematical tone of the 1978 book.

<!-- TODO
  - reference OBDDs (post 1970), although this an application
  - but not much research @ foundations i.e. det/nondet/regex
  - ANNs tend to be acyclic layers (Kleene ignored)
  - algebraic automata theory not helpful in applications
    e.g. Krohn-rhodes decomposition too large
  - missing a "nice" mathematical theory of complexity
    e.g. ANN much more succinct than dfa,
    e.g. but nfas allow superstates

Although heavy-handed, it rings true: automata theory is not the research frontier it once was. <!-- It _is_ an active research area (e.g. <Ext href="https://eatcs.org/index.php/best-icalp-paper">ICALP</Ext>, <Ext href="https://link.springer.com/conference/fossacs">FoSSaCS</Ext>, <Ext href="http://lics.siglog.org/">LiCS</Ext>) but does _not_ have a commonly accepted set of open problems. -->
Established problems exist e.g. those <Ext href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121153502500075">presented by Brzozowski in 1979</Ext> and <Ext href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01614375v2/document">reappraised by Jean-Eric Pin in 2015</Ext>, but they're only on the radar of a select few. More importantly, automata theory no longer pursues the questions posed by _Automata Studies_, nor other questions of a similar universal appeal.

So, what happened?

- Positive viewpoint
- Negative viewpoint


<!-- The question moved into AI and Computational Complexity -->
<!-- Mathematical maturity, out of step with applications -->

<!-- - The questions posed by Automata Studies have universal appeal.
- Artificial Intelligence has PAC Learning
- Computational Complexity has the P vs NP question. -->
