## Objectives <float rem="1.2">19th July 2021</float>

We are going to build a game step-by-step directly on this website.
It will be a realtime [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike).
As an important side-effect, we'll see how modern frontend development works.

### Constraints

For such a project to take shape, a large number of decisions must be made. Here are some of the most important ones.

- The setting, items and characters come from [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)) or [NetHack](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/NetHack).
- Birdseye realtime viewpoint, inspired by [Teleglitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleglitch).
- Styled [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) instead of Terminal/Tiles, HTMLCanvas or WebGL.
- Complete behavioural rewrite.
- Behaviours are visually indicated.

It is worth explaining the motivation behind these decisions. First of all, finishing a game is notoriously hard.
The creator of Spelunky suggested [three requirements](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game):

1. __Games I want to make__: the process itself should be fun.
  
  > Marked improvements in Game AI occur rarely.
  Many games feel like previous incarnations wearing new clothes.
  On the other hand, _better Game AI_ is a ridiculously vague notion.
  We are talking about a loosely-defined bunch of algorithms which play an important supporting role.
  Nevertheless, for improvements in NPC behaviour to be _felt_, they must be observable by the player.
  Then one approach is to visually indicate NPC decision-making, making it a central mechanic.


2. __Games I want to have made__: we should care about the end result.

> two

3. __Games Iâ€™m good at making__: it should suit our taste and experience.

> three


### Stepwise

## Components

_TODO rewrite as 'technology we will use'_

Competing web frameworks exist in the wild, often with their own notion of component.
A popular approach is to use [React functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) i.e. _JavaScript functions_ which:
- have a single parameter, conventionally called _props_.
- return a virtual [DOM node](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node).

The single argument _props_ is a JavaScript object defining the component's named inputs.
But what is a _virtual_ DOM node?
First consider how they denoted, via syntactic sugar known as [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

Recall that the only programming language web browsers natively understand is JavaScript.

### Birdseye view

### Intended implementation

We are going to built the game __directly on this website__, using well-established technologies.
