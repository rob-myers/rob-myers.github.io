## Finishing

Over time we'll clarify the above constraints, but first we emphasise:
> _creating a video game is really fucking hard_.

Spelunky's creator suggested [three important requirements](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game) for finishing a game.
We'll address them.

### 1. Fun to develop

_Games I want to make_. My underlying motivation is the lack of Game AI resources available on the web.
It is hard to discuss the subject without actually building a game, so I chose a setting and game mechanics which felt fun for me.
I am particularly interested in navigation i.e. combining the movement of many characters in a flexible manner.

### 2. The Result

_Games I want to have made_. As an end result I want a highly replayable tactical/action game sandbox.
Procedurally generated missions will involve going from A to B and doing C (ever was it so).
Monotony will be overcome via encountered NPC behaviours and e.g. ship building.
Functionally, think [Teleglitch](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Teleglitch) with richer NPCs and the ability to _place_ [room modules](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=175359117) when upgrading/docking.
Graphically, see Starship Geomorphs 2.0.

_The Last Redoubt_ will be easily extendable.
We'll provide compositional code, escape hatches to CodeSandbox, clear explanations, and [GitHub](https://github.com/) comments.

### 3. Experience

_Games Iâ€™m good at making_. I work as a web developer, using React and CSS-in-JS on a daily basis. 
I have a [strong background](https://dblp.org/pid/81/8748.html) in Theoretical Computer Science,
so won't confuse Game AI with AI, nor fall prey to the Deep Learning hype.
I have also created similar game mechanics _many_ times over the years.
Here's hoping my chain of unfinished projects is coming to a close!
