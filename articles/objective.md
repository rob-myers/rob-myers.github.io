## Objective

We are going to create a **video game**.
Yes... yet more escapism.

**Unusually**, we'll
(a) describe the process in detail,
(b) use standard web dev techniques,
(c) develop rich Game AI.

_Let's explain ourselves with a bunch of Q and A._

Where will it take place?
> In the [The Night Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land "@new-tab") (reinterpreted).

> The Night Land contains the _The Last Redoubt_,
> a gigantic pyramid protecting the last of humanity.
> It encloses 1320 cities in total,
> the first 1000 forming an inner ziggurat (see below).

<div
  class="tabs"
  name="redoubt-sketch-1"
  height="450"
  enabled="true"
  tabs="[
    { key: 'component', filepath: 'example/Images#redoubt-sketches' },
  ]"
></div>

__TODO__ 2 more screenshots above: 125 floors, the upper pyramid


What kind of game is it?
> A top-down adventure game.

What are _standard_ web development techniques?
> Those technologies used on an everyday basis by web developers.
> Then we exclude WebGL, physics engines and
> character walk-cycles.

Why Game AI?
> Standard techniques limit the graphics.
> On the other hand, the world is awash with games which are beautifully-crafted, yet ultimately rather shallow.

<!-- Because [NPC](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter) behaviour is more interesting than any particular game. -->
<!-- > An environment is needed to make behaviour meaningful, fixed narratives/missions are not. -->

We'l build Game AI _interactively_ using a browser-based terminal. For example, try copy-pasting the following script below:

__TODO__ a meaningful example ðŸš§

~~~
myFunc() {
  call '() => Array.from(Math.PI.toString())' |
  split |
  map 'x => `Digit: ${x}`'
}
~~~


  <div
    class="tabs"
    name="terminal-demo"
    height="300"
    tabs="[
      { key: 'terminal', filepath: 'test' },
    ]"
  ></div>

  | Category | Examples  |
  | ------- | ---------- |
  | Nav | <span class="cmd">ls</span>, <span class="cmd">pwd</span>, <span class="cmd">cd /home/test</span>, <span class="cmd">cd ..</span> |
  | [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete "@new-tab") | <span class="cmd">echo foo >/home/bar</span>, <span class="cmd">/home/bar</span>, <span class="cmd">cd; rm bar</span> |
  | Out | <span class="cmd">seq 10</span>, <span class="cmd">echo foo{1..5}</span>, <span class="cmd">expr '2**10'</span> |

Let's spend some time providing the backdrop

__FROM HERE__ would like
- _TODO_ __ideas about characters and storylines__ e.g. 64 floors, floor layout; protagonist; other characters; natural mental states are unskillful; watchers represent fetters e.g. worry, ill-will etc.
- _TODO_ __clearer ideas about gameplay__ e.g. exploration; procedural generation; time-limited navpath motion; mental weaponry related to mental training; travel within the Night Land; ultimate goal e.g. deathless

We'll use [navigation meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh) to simulate starship inhabitants,
following the rules of [Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_%28role-playing_game%29).
To makes things less abstract, here's a Traveller-based asset called a _geomorph_.


<div
  class="tabs"
  name="geomorph-301-debug"
  height="400"
  tabs="[{ key: 'component', filepath: 'example/Images#geomorph-301' }]"
></div>

We've recreated **Geomorph 301** (a.k.a. _Bridge_) from Robert Pearce's [Starship Geomorphs 2.0](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-starship-geomorphs-book-if-finally.html),
using 8 of his [Starship Symbols](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2020/08/starship-symbols-book.html).
Obstacles you can see over are shaded grey e.g. chairs and beds.
Walls and obstacles which cannot be seen over are darker grey and black. The underlying polygons of these obstacles, together with the white rectangular doors, induce the _white triangulated navigable polygon_ shown above.

> Check out this [larger version](/pics/g-301--bridge.debug.x2.png "@new-tab").

<aside>

A _Starship Geomorph_ is a rectangular partial floorplan of a starship, designed to be cut out and possibly glued to others.
They were created by Robert Pearce, and distributed as a PDF on his [blog](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/).
A 2nd version was released in 2020, along with another PDF containing many individual symbols e.g. offices, fuel tanks and bedrooms. Soon afterwards Eric B. Smith transformed them into [transparent PNGs](http://gurpsland.no-ip.org/geomorphs/).
The latter 2000+ symbols will form the underlying basis of _The Last Redoubt_.

</aside>

__TODO__ remove Visibility and Css3d demo, replacing with NPC demo combined with terminal in some way.

<!-- We end with two basic demos.
You can pan/zoom, move the eyes, and view the obstacle polygons in 3D.
There are respective CodeSandboxes i.e. [visibility](https://codesandbox.io/s/rogue-markup-visibility-demo-k66zi?file=/src/example/Visibility.jsx "@new-tab") and [height](https://codesandbox.io/s/rogue-markup-3d-demo-forked-gyher?file=/src/example/Css3d.jsx "@new-tab"). -->


<div
  class="tabs"
  name="light-demo"
  height="340"
  tabs="[
    // { key: 'component', filepath: 'example/Visibility#301' },
    { key: 'component', filepath: 'example/Css3d#301' },
  ]"
></div>
