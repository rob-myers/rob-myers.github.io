Fun to develop\n\n_Games I want to make_. My underlying motivation is the lack of Game AI resources available on the web.\nIt is hard to discuss the subject without actually building a game, so I chose a setting and game mechanics which felt fun for me.\nI am particularly interested in navigation i.e. combining the movement of many characters in a flexible manner.\n\n### 2. The Result\n\n_Games I want to have made_. As an end result I want a highly replayable tactical/action game sandbox.\nProcedurally generated missions will involve going from A to B and doing C (ever was it so).\nMonotony will be overcome via encountered NPC behaviours and e.g. ship building.\nFunctionally, think [Teleglitch](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Teleglitch) with richer NPCs and the ability to _place_ [room modules](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=175359117) when upgrading/docking.\nGraphically, see Starship Geomorphs 2.0.\n\nRogue Markup will be easy to extend.\nWe\'ll achieve this via compositional code, escape hatches to CodeSandbox, clear explanations, and [GitHub](https://github.com/) comments.\n\n### 3. Experience\n\n_Games I\u2019m good at making_. I work as a web developer, using React and CSS-in-JS on a daily basis. \nI have a [strong background](https://dblp.org/pid/81/8748.html) in Theoretical Computer Science,\nso won\'t confuse Game AI with AI, nor fall prey to the Deep Learning hype.\nI have also created similar game mechanics _many_ times over the years.\nHere\'s hoping my chain of unfinished projects is coming to a close!'},38701:function(e,n){"use strict";n.Z='## Objective\n\nWe\'ll create a _Game AI focused_ roguelike, set in the [Traveller universe](https://travellermap.com/?p=-1.329!-23.768!3).\n\n_Why?_\n\nBecause [NPC](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter) behaviour is more interesting than any particular game.\nAn environment is needed to make it meaningful, fixed narratives/missions are not.\n\nWe\'ll focus on combining navigation-based behaviours in a flexible manner.\nGame AI should be compositional, not forced into a narrative straight-jacket.\nAs for the environment, it will be driven by thousands of Traveller-based assets.\n\n<div\n  class="tabs"\n  id="tabs-geomorph-301-debug"\n  height="340"\n  tabs="[{ key: \'component\', filepath: \'images/Gm301Debug\' }]"\n></div>\n\nAbove we\'ve recreated Geomorph 301 (a.k.a. _Bridge_) from [Starship Geomorphs 2.0](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-starship-geomorphs-book-if-finally.html),\nusing 8 assets from [Starship Symbols](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/2020/08/starship-symbols-book.html).\n\n> A larger version is [available](/pics/g-301--bridge.debug.x2.png "@new-tab").\n\nRoughly speaking, a "Starship Geomorph" is a rectangular slice of a starship designed to be cut out and glued to others.\nThey were created by Robert Pearce, and distributed as PDFs on his [blog](http://travellerrpgblog.blogspot.com/).\nTheir 2nd version was released in 2020, and soon afterwards Eric B. Smith transformed them into [transparent PNGs](http://gurpsland.no-ip.org/geomorphs/).\nThe latter 2000+ symbols will form the underlying basis of _Rogue Markup_.\n'}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,188,651,13,888,179],(function(){return n=44690,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
