It adjusts the [SVG viewBox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/viewBox) in response to mouse/pointer events.\n\n- _Grid_ renders part of an SVG i.e. two grid patterns.\n  They repeat squares of size 10x10 and 60x60 in abstract [SVG user units](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/coords.html#TermUserUnits "@new-tab").\n\n  <aside>\n  \n  SVG user units become concrete via the `<svg>`\'s viewBox attribute and its width/height within the DOM.\n  We\'ll follow a convention based on the work of Robert Pearce and Eric B. Smith. That is, 60 abstract user units (one large grid square) correspond to 1.5 meters.\n  </aside>\n\nThe above two JS functions each have a single parameter `props`, and return something which looks like HTML (but isn\'t).\nFor example, _PanZoom_ renders _Grid_ by using the XML tag `<Grid/>`.\nThen although React function components are functions, syntactically they are not invoked like functions i.e. we do not write `Grid(props)`.\nBut what are React function components actually returning?\nHere\'s a whirlwind overview.\n\n- React devs use a grammatical extension of JS with XML called [JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)).\n- React applications are built by composing React function components, using the XML syntax for their return value.\n- Dev tools convert JSX into JS by replacing XML tags with invocations of `React.createElement` ([example/jsx-to-js.jsx](#command "open-tab jsx-to-js")).\n- This website actually uses _Preact_, a React alternative with the same API.\n  Then `React.createElement` is [this function](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/master/src/create-element.js "@new-tab"),\n  and creates Preact virtual DOM nodes.\n- The root component is usually called _App_.\n  Running a React application means [invoking `ReactDOM.render`](https://codesandbox.io/s/rogue-markup-panzoom-yq060?file=/src/index.js "@new-tab")\n  with 2 arguments: `<App/>` and a DOM node _el_.\n\n- [`ReactDOM.render`](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/master/src/render.js "@new-tab") initially converts `<App/>` into a DOM node mounted at _el_.\n  A subcomponent may re-render, recursively recreating a virtual DOM node.\n  It is [diffed](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/master/src/diff/index.js "@new-tab") and only the difference is applied to the DOM.\n\n<div\n  class="tabs"\n  height="340"\n  store-key="jsx-to-js"\n  tabs="[ { key: \'code\', filepath: \'example/jsx-to-js.jsx\' } ]"\n></div>\n\n### Avoiding React Renders\n\n\x3c!--\nWebsites respond to interaction, sometimes without changing the DOM.\nWhen they do mutate the DOM, they usually don\'t continually do so.\nFor example, zooming a map can be done with a CSS transform and a pre-existing CSS transition.\nAs another example, showing additional search results amounts to a single mutation.\n--\x3e\n\nWhen React renders a component, it computes a rooted subtree of the virtual DOM,\ncompares the previous one, and patches the DOM.\nIf many components change in a small amount of time, [some renders are automatically avoided](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/ebd87f3005d9558bfd3c5f38e0496a5d19553441/src/component.js#L221 "@new-tab") via the ancestral relationship.\nDevelopers can also avoid recreating an entire rooted subtree using [`React.memo`](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/master/compat/src/memo.js "@new-tab").\nBut for many websites, the virtual DOM manipulations are neither too large nor too frequent, and React developers may simply ignore their overhead.\n\nHowever, we are making a realtime video game.\nWe want to control the rendering as much as possible, to ensure good performance and aid debugging e.g. when many objects are onscreen.\nIf we allowed React (actually, Preact) to render in response to user interaction, we\'d lose this control.\nTake another look at _panzoom/PanZoom.jsx_.\n\n<div\n  class="tabs"\n  height="360"\n  store-key="panzoom-again"\n  tabs="[\n    { key: \'code\', filepath: \'panzoom/PanZoom.jsx\' },\n    { key: \'code\', filepath: \'geom/rect.js\' },\n  ]"\n></div>\n\n_PanZoom_ returns an `<svg/>` with a viewBox attribute determined by `state.viewBox`.\nWhen a user zooms via mousewheel, the event handler `state.onWheel` updates `state.viewBox`.\nBut updating this variable does not automatically update the virtual DOM.\nUsually one would _trigger a re-render_, so that _PanZoom_ returns `<svg/>` with the updated viewBox, and the DOM-diffing algorithm does the update.\nBut how do we trigger a re-render?\n\nA React function component is rendered if an ancestor is (modulo React.memo), or if its internal state changes. Internal state is represented using the [React.useState hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) e.g.\n\n> `const [value, setValue] = React.useState(() => initialValue)`\n\nThese declarations cannot be nested, must occur at the "top-level" of the React function component, and must always execute in the same order.\nThis induces a [well-defined association](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/98f130ee8695c2b4f7535205ddf02168192cdcac/hooks/src/index.js#L109 "@new-tab") with their enclosing component.\nTo change state we execute `setValue(nextValue)` e.g. in response to a click. If `nextValue` differs from `value`, the function `setValue` causes the component to re-render where now `React.setState(...)[0]` has the new value.\nThis propagation of internal state is possible because hooks must always execute in the same order.\n\nIn _panzoom/PanZoom.jsx_, `value` corresponds to `state` but there is no correspondent of `setValue`.\nWhy?\nBecause we never inform React we\'ve changed `state`, despite mutating it on mouse and pointer events.\nInstead we directly mutate the DOM via:\n\n> ``state.root.setAttribute(\'viewBox\', `${state.viewBox}`);``\n\n\x3c!-- By the way, `` `${state.viewBox}` `` amounts to `state.viewBox.toString()` which is defined in [geom/rect.js](#command "open-tab panzoom-again code--geom/rect.js"). --\x3e\n\nAs far as React is concerned nothing has changed.\nAlso, if React renders for another reason (e.g. an ancestral render), it\'ll use the mutated `state` to set the viewBox attribute (so, no change).\nWhy bother though?\nTo avoid needlessly recomputing `<Grid />` and `children` whenever we pan or zoom.\nOur game may contain many elements, and we\'d rather not recompute their virtual DOM many times per second.\n\nThe above situation is handled by a single DOM mutation.\nIn more complex situations we\'ll integrate [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).\nMore on that later.\n\n\x3c!-- ### CSS inside JS\n\nTraditionally, CSS is provided in separate files,\nlinked in the `<head/>` and referenced by DOM elements via their space-separated attribute `class`.\nBoth _PanZoom_ and _PanZoomDemo_ above are styled using CSS-in-JS.\nThis means the CSS is written inside JS or JSX files, often together with the React component it applies to.\nThe npm module [Goober](https://www.npmjs.com/package/goober) handles this for us. --\x3e\n'}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,35,953,888,179],(function(){return n=23752,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
