We've got an online AI engine.
- missing steiners/triggers/rays
- missing comments via GitHub Issues
- but shouldn't be too hard

Our blog could be:
- a bunch of ai examples
- an ai-game built step-by-step online
- mathematically oriented

A _soul_ is missing.
> Even if we create independent AI examples, one or more settings is needed to bring it to life.

@design ideas from Teleglitch
- doors, lighting, zooming
- maybe scenery such as engines/ladders

@setting ideas
- research institute studying neural scans of meditators
- "we've identified a stable neurostate during the jhanic phase"
- "this state naturally embeds a memory lattice of large length"
- "it is an irreducible representation of a simple monoid"
- we built AI by imitating nature i.e. by simulating a prime
  component highlighted during jhanic meditation
