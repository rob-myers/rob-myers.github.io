We've got an online AI engine.
- missing steiners/triggers/rays
- missing comments via GitHub Issues
- but shouldn't be too hard

Our blog could be:
- a bunch of ai examples
- an ai-game built step-by-step online
- mathematically oriented

A _soul_ is missing.
> Even if we create independent AI examples, one or more settings is needed to bring it to life.

@design use ideas from Teleglitch:
- doors, lighting, zooming
- scenery such as engines and ladders

@setting adapt Teleglitch:
- you must escape the "mad" Main AI
- you are a robot (in Teleglitch you are human)
- why is Main AI mad?
