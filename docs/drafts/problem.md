## Defining the blog

We hesitate to imagine a world
Fundamentally want both art and science

### `Layers`

1. shell (terminal) for js and three.js ✔︎
2. top-down 3d world like teleglitch ✔︎
3. weapons/game-mechanic
4. story/characters/setting/design/levels

Missing layer strategy:
- bring in 'science' via game-mechanic (3)
- use game-mechanic to drive (4)

### `Game mechanic`

- Actors have regex which determines their behaviour.
- Can echo actor regex to terminal.
- Possibly can inspect regex as nfa.
- Player can scan actors to see regexes in terminal.
- Regex can be changed by weapons e.g. word derivative.
