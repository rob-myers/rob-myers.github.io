# Website objectives

We plan to create a website concerned with Game AI. We will provide an editor so scenarios can be created and experienced. Users of the website can create scenarios and save them as textual "comments". The website will be arranged as a blog e.g. concerned with a particular setting, or a particular Game AI technique. There will also be a general area where users can post ideas/scenarios unrelated to the blog posts.

## The editor

The editor consists of one or more `Terminal`s and a `Stage`.


### TODO

- have `Terminal`
- can create and close additional `Terminal`s
- have `Stage`
- can use `Terminal` to create rectilinear polygons in `Stage`
