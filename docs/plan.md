## TODO (story-mechanics)

### Backdrop

The Last Redoubt in The Night Land.
> https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10662/pg10662.html

### Story Objective

The protagonist (Andros) has just travelled through the first 1000 cities i.e. The Ziggurat.

> And this story I heard everywhere in my travels through the cities of the Great Redoubt, which travels began when I came upon my seventeenth year, and continued for ~~three~~ _two_ years and two hundred and ~~twenty five~~ _seventy_ days, being even then but one day in each city, as was the custom in the training of every child.

Andros is known for the uncanny nature of his Brain-Elements.
He has exhibited remote transmission and hearing, with unconfirmed relic manifestation and prior life memories.
In so far as these memories are concerned, the Historians apparently want to believe him -- a rare event in itself!

Naturally, the Sangha has insisted he ordain as a Novice in the Upper Pyramid.

- ✅ Customizable light position via meta points
- ✅ Improve track:
  - **SMOOTHNESS FIRST** approach (mobile, in particular)
  - ✅ Comment out `track` and `trackNew`
  - ✅ `walk` animation (for global nav) is one large animation
  - ✅ separate NPC out of NPCs
  - ✅ use cancellable timeouts for events
  - ✅ `track` panzoom-to
  - ✅ `track`awaits termination

  - ✅ transform latter into navMetas
  - ✅ replace old approach and start testing
- ✅ BUG when NavDemo1 starts hidden, gmGraph hull doors have doorId -1
  - `useGeomorphData`
  - if g-301--bridge.json fetched twice before NavDemo1 init
  - if switch from NavDemo1 to SvgStringPull
  - fixed via `staleTime: Infinity` useGeomorphData
    - so must refresh onchange geomorph jsons
    - permit edit useGeomorphData though
- ✅ LocalNavPath can start/end inside a doorway
  - ✅ door entry/exit just outside doorway
  - ✅ ensure pulled path 2nd/penultimate not inside doorway by removing points
  - ✅ `nodeToMeta` doorId and roomId are clearly understood
    - _nav node has doorId_ iff tri intersects door rect
    - _nav node has roomId_ iff tri has ≥ 2 points in room
      i.e. could be totally in room, or in doorway with 1 edge in room.
    - cannot expect nav node with doorId to _always_ have a roomId,
      due to particular triangulation
  - ✅ LocalNavPath has alternating node/edge paths
  - ✅ discard 1-path when end in doorway and room changes across door nodes
  - ✅ if start navnode with doorId not inside door, light should trigger
  - ✅ if player ends in a doorway, lights shouldn't switch,
       because have not entered another room

  - ✅ Fix `kill --STOP {pid}` e.g. for `click`
  - ❌ shorten script validation via `api.something`
  - ✅ can toggle draw navpath via DEBUG=true
  - ✅ cache parsed scripts
  - ✅ tty can await some `<NPCs/>` ready
  - ✅ avoid mobile click-spawn toggling animation (debug)
  - 🤔 game functions take single input like `"{ name: 'andros', at: $(click 1) }"`
    > worse for mobile, but avoids arbitrary choices/validation
  - ✅ `npc {key}` gets api
  - ✅ script spawns andros and periodically panzooms back to him
    - ✅ jerkiness reintroduced when `view ...`
  - ✅ improve camera tracking
    - ✅ `view` should only terminate when finished/interrupted
    - ✅ `view` expects param e.g. `{ zoom: 2, ms: 2000, to: { "x": 100, "y": 100 } }`
    - ✅ can specify transition time in `view` too
    - ❌ returns to circle around npc after 300ms of no camera interaction
    - ✅ abstract into `track &`
- ✅ Can zoom to point with animation
- ✅ Interruptible zoom without lock
  - `matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)` -> `scale(k) translate(x, y)`
  - `scale(k) translate(x, y)` = `matrix(k, 0, 0, k, x, y)`
- ✅ fix issue with `transition` of matrix transform involving scale and translate (looks crap)
  - ✅ split CSSPanZoom into two transforms i.e. scale and translate
    now essentially `translate(x, y) scale(k)` spread across 2 elems
  - ✅ animate both

  - ✅ actuated via shell function `move`
  - ✅ turn correctly (not look)

  - ✅ NPC refreshes with HMR
  - ✅ fix bug going through wall

- ✅ NavDemo1 init race condition?
  - fixed by useEffect -> useMemo in useGeomorphs and doorsApi setup triggers render
- ✅ replace "stage" with "wire"
- ✅ spawn has format `spawn rob ["$( position )"]`
- ✅ NavDemo1 has 2 or more geomorphs
- ❌ Stage can access spawnPoints from useGeomorphData

  - ✅ AStar takes account of doors
  - ✅ Local navpaths go through doors
    - Break into multiple paths and doorIndex
    - Consumer will decide strategy
  - ✅ Clarify "Global nav path strategy"
    ```
    Line "src -> dst" induces global path
    1. Detect direction e.g. SW, and choose closest open door (straight line)
    2. By construction some edge can be taken; never deadlock
    ```
  - ✅ Implement global navpaths
  - ✅ curved windows can produce strange light
       we introduced `one-way` (like `frosted`) to avoid
       outside from control room seeing more than inside
  - local nav path issues
    - ✅ lazily precompute room navpolys restricted to roomWithDoors
    - ✅ initial room ray cast avoids some string pull issues
    - 🤔 seen string-pull of poor quality whose reverse is good
    - 🤔 avoid going outside navmesh
    - ✅ use connector.entries instead of centroids of nav nodes
    - ✅ works when src and dst in same triangle
  - ✅ `nav` receives `{ paths, edges }`
- ✅ HMR when edit class methods (GmGraph)
  - bizarre: HMR/react-refresh works when classes start with lowercase letter!

    > Ensure all exports within the indirect code path are not named in PascalCase. This will tell the Babel plugin to do nothing when it hits those files.
    > In general, the PascalCase naming scheme should be reserved for React components only, and it doesn't really make sense for them to exist within non-React-rendering contexts.

# this crashes -- can we prevent it?
run '({}) { while (true) yield undefined; }'

  await api.sleep(1)
  yield "foo"
} }'
```

- ✅ replace various shell commands by shell functions and `run`
- ✅ simplify `help`
- ✅ better persistence
  > as in [three-cli branch](https://github.com/rob-myers/rob-myers.github.io/blob/9b2c7e3dc7f17b51a6d18663cf7c5039c78dcdf0/store/code.store.ts#L40).

	- ✅ Redo redirects
	- ✅ Redo `get`, bare `get`, `cd`, `ls`, `rm`
- ✅ `api.read` can read lines from tty
- ✅ redirect into cwd rather than `var`
- ✅ support ansi-codes in `$'...'`
- better error "stacks"
  > ✅ have node.meta.stack with function names

  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-jsx-highlighter
  - https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-styled-plugin#configuration (might work?)
  - https://luminaxster.github.io/syntax-highlighter/

# Motivation

Breath life into it via 
- [Traveller wiki](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Main_Page)
- [Bardo Thodol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Thodol)
  - Ship AIs assist Low Berth travellers on death
- [The Night Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land)

Breath depth into it via navigation (sans physics)
- waypoints/waypaths induced via symbols
- scheduler moves all agents, subject to constraints
- player can navigate freely via navmesh
- player may be stopped, but
  - can drag invalid waypoints
  - wait for them to become valid
# Technical constraints

Cannot use e.g. Svelte because HMR/Fast-Refresh does not work on  CodeSandbox (or elsewhere), and we'll need that for AI editing later.

As close to JavaScript as possible.
- Styled jsx with JSDoc types instead of styled tsx
- Projects should only rely on React for _initial render_
- Dom mutations should be done manually e.g. via Web Components
- Projects should avoid SSR

> After the introduction of the pre-parser, when V8 encounters a function, __it will not skip the function directly__, but will perform this fast pre-analysis on the function. The pre-analysis has two tasks

  > 1. Determine whether the current function has a syntax error
If there is a syntax error in this function, there is no need to continue execution
  > 2. Check whether the external variable is referenced inside the function. If the external variable is referenced, the pre-parser will copy the variable in the stack to the heap. When the function is executed next time, it will directly use the reference in the heap to solve the problem. The problem with the package.

Hopefully it caches this analysis, so, almost always, function declarations just amount to storing a name and some code.
