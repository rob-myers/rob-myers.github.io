## Plan

- Write down a summary of what we are trying to do.
- All running examples are Game AI

### service-worker
- ✅ can respond with type `application/javascript`
- ✅ `import('/src/module.js')` does not refetch,
  although `import('/src/module.js?v=2')` would.

### shell
- Perhaps use unix-like paths e.g. `/home/src` instead of `/home.src`?
	> Will need to redo redirects
	- Will need to redo `get`, bare `get`, `cd`, `ls`, ... more?
- can trigger shell command from markdown link
- improve `help`
- ✅ `api.read` can read lines from tty
- ✅ redirect into cwd rather than `var`
- ✅ support ansi-codes in `$'...'`
- better error "stacks"
  > ✅ have node.meta.stack with function names
 can load modules from unpkg, caching source

### Module over-caching issue

Javascript modules cannot be invalidated from cache, without refresh.
This means hot-reloading will create many stale ones via `import('/src/module.js?v=2')`,
potentially for every module along unique (modulo dependency cycles) path to root.

- first statically determine import/export dependency graph
- assume it is acyclic with a single entrypoint
- convert modules to commonjs or similar
- ...
