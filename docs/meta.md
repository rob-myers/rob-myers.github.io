We now work towards the content of the website i.e. our 1st blog entry.

We should include hands-on examples in each post.

# What

We propose a standardized approach to Game AI:
> a particular way of _writing_, _playing_ and _editing_ character behaviour.

The entire system runs online right here; it also integrates into a modern web development environment. Our target audience is anyone with an interest in simulating human behaviour.

# Why

Games permit an individual or small team to communicate an experience/simulation/story to many people. It is particularly difficult to design the behaviour of non-player characters. We provide a prototyping tool whose behaviours can be easily migrated to other codebases.


Each game has its nuances, but there is sufficient common ground to warrant abstraction.
For example, the subsection titles in [_AI for Games_](#cite-ai-for-games) have changed little from 2004 (1st edition) to 2019 (3rd edition).
