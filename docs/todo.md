# A collaborative game engine

See [blog notes](./blog.md).

Although we provide development environments, this is not our objective.
- We'll represent worlds using `react` e.g. level geometry via React components.
- Dev envs will permit interact with the world. 
- They'll provide a malleable 'UI' via react hot reloading.

# Fresh start @ August 2020

[x] rename `geom.types.ts` as `geom.types.d.ts` inside runtime
[ ] multiple layouts for `DevEnv`; support additional files
[ ] standard apps/components persist via portals too
[x] dev-env includes scss
[x] mirroring i.e. get intro/bipartite working in main codebase
[ ] typescript inside mdx?
[x] simultaneous apps from different packages
  > `DevApp` and portals need to know appRoot
[ ] Blog 1st i.e. write content 1st
[x] No goldenlayout, use mdx instead
[x] Only tsx and scss
[x] Instead of ts use npm modules provided via thunks
[x] Use optimal hot-reloading strategy in development
  > non-standard thunk middleware
  > need to replace thunks on hot reload
[x] Same store/thunks in dev/runtime
[x] Generate `react-redux.d.ts`
  > write 'self-contained' reducers importing from `package/types/{reducer}.types.ts`
[ ] Implement `module-registry` instead of blob urls
[x] runtime tsx and scss available in dev


# Online Dev Environment

- [ ] can we replace blob urls by a `module-registry` or another method?
  > imported blob urls are not garbage collected
- [x] can switch between two projects
- [x] can close project and open another
  > e.g. by attempting to bootstrap new app then new reducer

- [x] `bipartite` package is project with demo
- [x] can ensure packages and have loaded `bipartite` package
- [x] projects have a layout via `layout.saved`
- [ ] package files are read-only
- [x] panel title shows package filename as `@{package}/rest/of/path`
  > somewhat misleading because must use `@package/{package}/rest/of/path`.
- [ ] start work on svg-based rectilinear level-designer
- [ ] convert npm module `rectangle-decomposition` into a package
- [x] use `@package` instead of `@module`

- [x] create projects and modules inside `public/packages`
- [x] can save current files to disk as json
- [x] resolve files like `@module/core/util`.
- [x] live tsconfig has alias `@module` resolving to top-level-dir `module`
- [x] move `declare module 'react-redux'` into `custom-types.d.ts`.
  > only at root, should not exist in our 'modules'
- [x] move `util` and `redux.model` to `module/core`
  > can import from `@module/core/util`, `@module/core/redux.model`.
- [ ] preserve large chunks during build
- [ ] add desktop/mobile layout; mobile layout prevents tab dragging/duplicating
- [ ] write a blog entry and show it in a doc panel

  > todo: add filepath error to CodeFile and StyleFile
  > todo: show error
- [x] bootstrap app even when no monaco editor panel initially open
- [x] detect `js` cyclic dep caused by `export { App } from './index'`
- [ ] handle persistence across multiple tabs
  > use local storage to track other tabs open

  > achievable using ES6 proxy https://stackoverflow.com/a/7891968/2917822
- [x] `scss` gets mounted inside `style` tag
- [x] `scss` supports `@import` when no cyclic deps
  > sass.js does not support `@use`
  > sass files need to be stratified (not transpiled css)
- [x] prefix sass classes using a sass parser
  > https://www.npmjs.com/package/scss-parser

- [x] store imports/exports ensuring acyclic, logging error
- [x] syntax worker analyzes transpiled js and extracts import/exports
- [x] typescript files can import from each other
  > default layout contains two files `index.tsx` and `model.ts`
- [x] Transpile via epic and store result, so can bootstrap app.
- [x] Track panel/file relationship in `dev-env.duck`.
- [x] Can see app.
  > could re-bootstrap app pre-transpile, if all others transpiled/up-to-date too.
  > need to know which imports js has, and must prevent cycles.

- [x] Integrate `golden-layout` (use previous approach) on new page `/dev`.
- [x] Rename worker.duck as editor.duck
- [x] Error boundary around mounted `App`
- [x] Syntax highlighting should be throttled
- [x] Mount transpiled react component (Dev)
  > transform `react` import path.

  > use this approach instead: https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/264#issuecomment-470777159
- [x] Import sass worker via module instead
  > https://github.com/medialize/sass.js/blob/HEAD/docs/getting-started.md#using-sassjs-with-a-module-loader
- [x] Syntax worker supports SASS -> CSS transpilation

- [x] Have CSS editor too
- [x] Implement TSX syntax-highlighting using prism in worker
- [x] Rename global.duck as worker.duck and level.worker as syntax.worker
- [x] Understand why `react-refresh` is remounting index.tsx
   > probably because `useEffect` with empty deps gets re-rerun
- [x] Start integrating our own version of `gitalk`
   > can retrieve issue and comments
   > decided against `gitalk` -- will remove
- [x] Upgrade next.js; get `react-refresh` working
   > https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4
- [x] Prod monaco build
- [x] Dev monaco build

# Infrastructure

- [ ] Create a Github App which can create gists for `@rob-myers`
- [ ] Get AWS-Lambda/DynamoDB working
- [ ] Get AWS-Lambda/S3 working
- [ ] Get AWS-Lambda working
- [x] Create AWS account `rob-myers-2020`

# Notes

Highlight fails e.g. `// {props.id}` but unlikely to happen and can be fixed via `{'//'} {props.id}`. However, these cases do arise via auto-commenting, so we need to fix that.

Avoid having `index.tsx` and `index.ts` -- they both transpile to `index.js`,
leading to `emitSkipped` in monaco emit output. Prevent files that are prefixes of others, or fix this assumption in code.
